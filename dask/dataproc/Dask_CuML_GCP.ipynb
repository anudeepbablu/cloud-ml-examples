    "__Dask__ is an open source library for parallel computing written in Python. Dask framework enables us to have a scheduler and a bunch of workers. You submit tasks to the scheduler and it automatically distributes the work among the workers. It works exceptionally well on a single machine, and can scale out to large clusters when needed. \n",

    "__RAPIDS CuML__ is a suite of fast, GPU-accelerated machine learning algorithms designed for data science and analytical tasks. Our API mirrors Sklearnâ€™s, and we provide practitioners with the easy fit-predict-transform paradigm without ever having to program on a GPU.\n",

    "__Dataproc__ is a fully managed and highly scalable service for running Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Presto, and 30+ open source tools and frameworks. It is a managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning. Dataproc automation helps you create clusters quickly, manage them easily, and save money by turning clusters off when you don't need them. With less time and money spent on administration, you can focus on your jobs and your data. \n",
